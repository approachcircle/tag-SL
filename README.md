this is a library that allows users to session lock their python projects easily.
# status
tag!-SL is not in a usable state currently, meaning that development is being made, but it is not in a state where it can be used for it's intended purpose yet.
# OS compatibility
this library is only compatible for windows right now, however a linux release could quite possibly be made, it probably wouldn't require anything difficult to be done for it.
